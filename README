Geometry::AffineTransform instances represent 2D affine transformations
that map 2D coordinates to other 2D coordinates. See the POD documentation
for details. The references in the SEE ALSO section provide background information
about affine transformations.

The module includes an RPM .spec file to build installation packages for RPM
based Linux distributions. You should be able to build the RPM directly from
the tar.gz distribution archive file with this command:

    rpmbuild -ta Geometry-AffineTransform-x.y.tar.gz

Thanks to Kevin Ryde for the invert() implementation.
